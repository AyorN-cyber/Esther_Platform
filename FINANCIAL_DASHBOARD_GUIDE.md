### 4. **Understanding the Dashboard**

**Green Numbers = Good** (Revenue/Profit)
**Red Numbers = Spending** (Expenses)

**Net Profit:**
- **Positive (Green):** You're making more than you're spending ✅
- **Negative (Red):** You're spending more than you're earning ⚠️

## Example Scenario

**Month 1:**
- Revenue: ₦50,000 (YouTube + Streaming)
- Expenses: ₦30,000 (Studio + Equipment)
- **Net Profit: ₦20,000** ✅ (You made profit!)

**Month 2:**
- Revenue: ₦40,000
- Expenses: ₦55,000 (Bought new camera)
- **Net Profit: -₦15,000** ⚠️ (You spent more than earned)
