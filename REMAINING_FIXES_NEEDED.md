## 🚧 Still Need to Fix:

### Critical Issues:

**1. Messages Disappearing**
- Issue: Chat messages clear after a few minutes
- Cause: Likely cloud sync overwriting with old data
- Fix Needed: Improve cloud sync logic to merge messages, not replace

**2. Notification Panel Too Big on Mobile**
- Issue: Notification dropdown cuts off screen on mobile
- Fix Needed: Make it responsive, smaller on mobile

**3. Video Management Cuts Off on Mobile**
- Issue: "Pending" status and other parts cut off
- Fix Needed: Make table responsive, stack on mobile

**4. Real Typing Indicator**
- Issue: Typing indicator is fake (always shows)
- Fix Needed: Implement real-time typing detection

**5. Login Notifications**
- Issue: No notification when she logs in
- Fix Needed: Add login event notification

### UI Improvements:

**6. More Emojis in Chat**
- Current: Limited emoji selection
- Needed: Add more categories and emojis

**7. Zigzag Line Chart**
- Current: Straight line chart
- Needed: Make it zigzag/curved like real charts

**8. More Animations**
- Needed: Add more smooth animations throughout

## 💡 Recommendations:

Due to the complexity and number of fixes, I recommend:

1. **Test current changes first** (stats section, About Me change)
2. **Tackle critical fixes one by one** to ensure quality
3. **Test each fix on mobile before moving to next**

Would you like me to:
- A) Continue with all fixes now (will take time)
- B) Focus on the most critical 3 fixes first
- C) Fix them in order of priority

Let me know and I'll proceed accordingly!
